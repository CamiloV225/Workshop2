# Workshop2: Análisis de Datos de Canciones de Spotify y Premios Grammy

This project focuses on the analysis and integration of datasets related to songs from the Spotify platform and the Grammy Awards. Through a series of data extraction, transformation and loading (ETL) steps, a comprehensive analysis of the musical characteristics of the songs, as well as their correlation with the awards received at the Grammy Awards, was performed. The project encompassed several stages, from data manipulation and cleaning to the creation of meaningful visualizations for a deeper understanding of musical patterns and trends.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project was to integrate data sets from Spotify and the Grammy Awards to identify meaningful relationships between the musical characteristics of songs and their recognition at the Grammy Awards. Through detailed analysis of key metrics, we sought to better understand the music industry's musical preferences, trends, and patterns in the context of music's most prestigious awards, the Grammy Awards.

## Prerequisites: Tools and libraries 
El proyecto hace uso de diversas bibliotecas de Python, como Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib y Seaborn. Asegúrese de tener estas bibliotecas instaladas antes de ejecutar los scripts o notebooks proporcionados en este repositorio.

## Setup
Here are the steps to set up the tool needed for this project:

First off, you would need a virtual machine or the equivalent of an WSL terminal, in my case i'm using wsl from the Microsoft Store: Ubuntu 22.04.

Once you setup your machine, you would need to install the following libraries to make it work:
NOTE: I recommend using a Virtual Enviroment for python, it will be better and even more organized than other projects.

```
pip install pandas apache-airflow mysql-connector-python mysqlclient pymysql
```
 

## Results
Detailed results of the analysis, including key visualizations and significant findings, are presented in the notebooks provided in this repository. It is recommended to review the notebooks to gain a full understanding of the patterns and trends uncovered during the analysis of the Spotify and Grammy datasets.
