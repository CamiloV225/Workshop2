# Workshop2: Spotify and Grammy Awards Song Data Analysis

This project focuses on the analysis and integration of datasets related to songs from the Spotify platform and the Grammy Awards. Through a series of data extraction, transformation and loading (ETL) steps, a comprehensive analysis of the musical characteristics of the songs, as well as their correlation with the awards received at the Grammy Awards, was performed. The project encompassed several stages, from data manipulation and cleaning to the creation of meaningful visualizations for a deeper understanding of musical patterns and trends.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project was to integrate data sets from Spotify and the Grammy Awards to identify meaningful relationships between the musical characteristics of songs and their recognition at the Grammy Awards. Through detailed analysis of key metrics, we sought to better understand the music industry's musical preferences, trends, and patterns in the context of music's most prestigious awards, the Grammy Awards.

## Prerequisites: Tools and libraries 
El proyecto hace uso de diversas bibliotecas de Python, como Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib y Seaborn. Aseg√∫rese de tener estas bibliotecas instaladas antes de ejecutar los scripts o notebooks proporcionados en este repositorio.

## Setup
1. Here are the steps to set up the tool needed for this project:

- First off, you would need a virtual machine or the equivalent of an WSL terminal, in my case i'm using wsl from the Microsoft Store: Ubuntu 22.04. Once you setup your machine, you would need to install the following libraries to make it work:

NOTE: I recommend using a Virtual Enviroment for python, it will be better and even more organized than other projects.

```
pip install pandas apache-airflow mysql-connector-python mysqlclient pymysql
```
2. Setup you Database Manager (In this case MySQL):
- Use the following command to access MySQL interface:
```
mysql -u root -p
```
- Then you will need to create the database that we will use for the project, For example:
```
CREATE DATABASE workshop2;
```
After that you can continue with the creation of the tables
3. Create folders to store the api_dag of airflow with the codes and necesary files:

```
mkdir airflow_exercise
```
4. If you setup everything correctly you can start airflow with the next commnads:
```
airflow scherduler
airflow standalone
```
5. Finally, open your web browser of preference and dile 'Localhost:8080', and trigger the api_dag, it will appear in the list of dags:
```
localhost:8080
```

## Results
Detailed results of the analysis, including key visualizations and significant findings, are presented in the notebooks provided in this repository. It is recommended to review the notebooks to gain a full understanding of the patterns and trends uncovered during the analysis of the Spotify and Grammy datasets.
